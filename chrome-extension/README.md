## Installation

### Step 1: Download the Extension

Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

### Step 2: Load in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right corner)

## How It Works

1. You log into Twitter/X normally in Chrome
2. Click the extension icon to open the composer
3. Write your tweet and click **Post** — the extension opens a compose tab in the background, types your tweet, and clicks post
4. The tab closes automatically and you get a success confirmation

**No API keys or developer accounts required!**

## Stash — Save Ideas for Later

Got a tweet idea but not ready to post? **Stash it.**

- Click the 🔖 **bookmark icon** next to the Post button to save your draft
- Switch to the **Stash tab** (bookmark icon in the header) to see all saved ideas
- **Edit** — tap the pencil icon to modify inline
- **Post** — tap the send icon to post directly from the stash
- **Delete** — tap the trash icon to remove

All stash data is stored locally in your browser — nothing leaves your machine.
